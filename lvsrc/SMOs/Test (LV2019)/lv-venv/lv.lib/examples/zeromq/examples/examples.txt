The following examples are provided to demonstrate LVZMQ:

"req-rep" is the simplest protocol, which uses REQuest and REPly sockets to send a request string and receive a reply. This is a one-one protocol.

"pub-sub" is the PUBlish/SUBscriber paradigm, that lets messages be broadcast from many publishers to potentially many subscribers. This can be used for many-many communication; spawn some VIs from the templates to see how.

"lazy-pirate" is a protocol described in "The Guide" for reliable one-one communication with resend-on-failure.

"example-app" shows how to build an application with the correct dependencies for an installer aimed at a target machine without LVZMQ installed.

"polling_events.vi" shows how to use LVZMQ to trigger events. Please note that using events is currently under testing and may be unstable in two-directional socket modes (i.e. use for SUB-only sockets, not REQ-REP sockets).
